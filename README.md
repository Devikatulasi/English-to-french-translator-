Methodology: Developed a sequence-to-sequence neural network model (Recurrent Neural Network - RNN) to translate text from English to French.
Languages/Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model creation, Flask for deployment.
Application/Use Case: This translator can be deployed for various applications such as language learning, website localization, and communication in multilingual environments. The model achieved 93.87% accuracy in translating sentences, providing an efficient deep learning-based language translation solution.
